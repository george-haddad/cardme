We want to be the best VCard library on the net, so if there is a bug or a new feature you want then let us know about it.

-------------------

Card Me Version 0.4.0-b2

Upgraded commons-codec-1.5 to 1.7
Card Me now requires Java 1.6.x or greater to work.

BUG[47]
GEO type using commas instead of decimals when run on system whose default locale is NL.

BUG[52]
Semi-colons and other special characters are now properly escaped in QUOTED-PRINTABLE fields.


Card Me Version 0.4.0-b1

!!!!!!
This is an early stage beta release, this is not meant for production use.
DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.
!!!!!!

This new version comes with a major over-haul of the API. The concept of using
cardme is still the same, but the methods and functions may have changed a bit.
Apologies for not completing the javadoc, wiki, user guide and developer guide
documentation as the developers of cardme have been very busy. All the docs will
be completed and provided on a gradual basis.

Previous release of 0.3.6 will NOT be discontinued. Version 0.4 and 0.3.x will
run in parallel. Version 0.3.x will be maintained for bug fixes and possible
feature updates, but the main focus will lay in version 0.4.

Please provide feedback (positive and negative) on the usage of cardme and
what can be improved. Remember that this project relies greatly on user
feedback. Use the Sourceforge forums and issue tracker to share your thoughts
and post bug/feature/patch requests.

CardMe thanks all its users for their support and greatly appreciate all those
who have posted bug reports, requested for new features and contributed patches
and code.

Card Me Version 0.2.0
---
Cardme has been completely re-written to utilize more efficient parsing
techniques as well as writing. The goal of this new version is to implement
VCard 3.0 features as much as possible and to make the Cardme library more
robust and scalable. New VCard features can be added in a modular fashion
which allows the engine to remain maintainable.

One of the other goals of cardme is to allow the developer/user to control
the formatting output of their vcards. We provide special classes that
control the formatting of parameter types and ISO codes. There is a compatibility
framework in use which allows for reading and writing of vcard features
to be modified to suit the target application's standards.

A strict emphasis on documentation and code style has been put into effect
to allow the project source to remain readable and maintainable. Any source
code that is mixed with many formatting styles will cause many headaches for
contributors and developers.

Error handling interfaces and implementation have been added to allow
exceptions to be thrown once detected or caught and stored within a
VCard object and then accessed later for repair or reporting.

Persistence interfaces have been added to make persisting vcards in
a database easier. One can write the VCard completely as a CLOB in
a database table and then read it and parse it back into a Java object.
But what if we want to use the RFC-2426 implementation of a contact as
a model to structure contact database and make it completely compatible
with exporting it as a VCard? this is where the persistence interface
comes into play. It allows each feature to be marked for persistence and
each can be marked as INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE or UNMARKED so that they can be
diverted to the appropriate SQL code. 

Cardme now is in its V3.0 testing phase and all errors should be reported
as bugs and will be fixed as soon as possible.

Card Me Version 0.1.3

Neighborhood Technologies and cardme contributors
Cardme is a Java VCard library which allows you to work with VCard objects
in java prorams. It allows the parsing of .VCF vcards into java VCard objects
and vice versa. Currently it complies with the VCard v2.1 standard and has
some support for v3.0.

The reason taken to add v2.1 support was mainly due to supporting some
integration with MS Outlook 2003+. Outlook support v2.1 vcards and even
not the whole standard. It exports its contacts into v2.1 vcards.
Not mentioning that they break MIME-DIR and ISO standards doing that.
I needed to swap back and forth VCards from Outlook to my java program
to a database and to other applications that use VCards to manage contacts.
So I coded full (as much as I could) v2.1 support into cardme.

Cardme also includes the MIME-DIR-J library from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mime-dir-j/
which should allow for more flexibility. As for version 0.1.1 card me depends on
the mime-dir-j libray. This library can be downloaded from cardme website.
