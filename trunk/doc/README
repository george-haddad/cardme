Card Me Version 0.2.0
---
Cardme has been completely re-written to utilize more efficient parsing
techniques as well as writing. The goal of this new version is to implement
VCard 3.0 features as much as possible and to make the Cardme library more
robust and scalable. New VCard features can be added in a modular fashion
which allows the engine to remain maintainable.

One of the other goals of cardme is to allow the developer/user to control
the formatting output of their vcards. We provide special classes that
control the formatting of parameter types and ISO codes. There is a compatibility
framework in use which allows for reading and writing of vcard features
to be modified to suit the target application's standards.

A strict emphasis on documentation and code style has been put into effect
to allow the project source to remain readable and maintainable. Any source
code that is mixed with many formatting styles will cause many headaches for
contributors and developers.

Error handling interfaces and implementation have been added to allow
exceptions to be thrown once detected or caught and stored within a
VCard object and then accessed later for repair or reporting.

Persistence interfaces have been added to make persisting vcards in
a database easier. One can write the VCard completely as a CLOB in
a database table and then read it and parse it back into a Java object.
But what if we want to use the RFC-2426 implementation of a contact as
a model to structure contact database and make it completely compatible
with exporting it as a VCard? this is where the persistence interface
comes into play. It allows each feature to be marked for persistence and
each can be marked as INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE or UNMARKED so that they can be
diverted to the appropriate SQL code. 

Cardme now is in its V3.0 testing phase and all errors should be reported
as bugs and will be fixed as soon as possible.

Card Me Version 0.1.4

The project has a new project lead and new contributors
we'll try to stick more closely to the VCard definition in http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2426.txt
We are starting to add JUnit tests and refractoring the software to reach this goal

Card Me Version 0.1.3
--
Neighborhood Technologies and cardme contributors
Cardme is a Java VCard library which allows you to work with VCard objects
in java prorams. It allows the parsing of .VCF vcards into java VCard objects
and vice versa. Currently it complies with the VCard v2.1 standard and has
some support for v3.0.

The reason taken to add v2.1 support was mainly due to supporting some
integration with MS Outlook 2003+. Outlook support v2.1 vcards and even
not the whole standard. It exports its contacts into v2.1 vcards.
Not mentioning that they break MIME-DIR and ISO standards doing that.
I needed to swap back and forth VCards from Outlook to my java program
to a database and to other applications that use VCards to manage contacts.
So I coded full (as much as I could) v2.1 support into cardme.

Cardme also includes the MIME-DIR-J library from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mime-dir-j/
which should allow for more flexibility. As for version 0.1.1 card me depends on
the mime-dir-j libray. This library can be downloaded from cardme website.
